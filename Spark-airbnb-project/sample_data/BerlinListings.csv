I love beaches, palm trees and out of the way places. 
Morocco, Portugal and Spain have become my favorite destinations and I prefer staying with local people so I really have a chance to learn about the area I am visiting. 
I am easy going and love making new friends! I love Yoga and fitness. I enjoy mindful and easy conversation and like to stretch a point.
I speak English, a little Spanish and a little French but found that communication is never a big problem as long as you trust in speaking gestures.
As one of the most experienced Airbnb Superhosts in Berlin I know how to be a mindful guest.
When I am at home and slip into the role of a host I am looking forward to welcoming you in my guestroom here in Prenzlauer Berg.
