Review 208779822 for listing 3109 by Patricia (4142888) on 2017-11-03:"Un petit nid fouiller douillet situé dans  appartement tranversant, très lumineux avec une fenêtre dans chaque piece! Situé au 4ème étage, sans ascenseur, même après une bonne journée de marche ne nous a pas paru pénalisant. Mais au contraire, dès l'entrée dans l'appartement,  une belle décoration, très confortable, bien équipé, un VRAI lit en 160cm digne de se nom vous, bous fera oublié les marchés montées....un vrai airbnb, où Anne nous confie son lieux de vie en toute confiance. 
Notre hôtes a été très réactive et nous a facilité notre séjour pour tous les points demandés.
Nous reviendrons chez Anne c'est sur si l'occasion se présente à nous.
 Merci encore."

Review 4824 for listing 5396 by Sarah (19995) on 2009-06-30:"Perfect location!! Nasrine was a delight and made the whole process very easy. We also had a problem with construction noise, but it's good that they're doing some upkeep on the building. Thanks for a lovely stay in Paris. We'll be back!"
Review 4968 for listing 5396 by Chris (20117) on 2009-07-03:"This is a nice place in a great location in Paris, and the woman helping the owner was very kind to us. Thanks for helping my brother and his wife have a great time."
Review 5240 for listing 5396 by Annelaure (22190) on 2009-07-08:"Nice studio, very clean, very quiet, in a great neighbourhood. Close to everything and very safe. The only down thing for me was that they were in the process of renovating the building and there were loud construction workers at my window starting at 8AM. For the rest, it was perfect."
Review 9619 for listing 5396 by Jean (11947) on 2009-09-10:"Superb location, great studio. 
A slice of Paris that is the real thing. 
Wonderful host. Friendly merchants, (we needed a corkscrew and the neighboring restaurant uncorked our bottle, on our way to an evening picnic along La Seine.

Review 18970 for listing 5396 by Bette (40625) on 2009-12-02:"Perfect place to be in Paris, walking home every night past Notre Dame and across the river through the old streets of the Ile St. Louis. The studio is just right- attractive, immaculate, with everything you could need."
Review 25574 for listing 5396 by Amy (50781) on 2010-02-07:"Wonderful hosts - very accommodating, friendly and responsive. The apartment was perfectly situated and very comfortable furnished. It was exactly as described. Thank you!"
Review 38642 for listing 5396 by Amy (106430) on 2010-04-28:"Best location in Paris - very privy location and walking distance to everything! The apartment is small but perfect for one or two persons. Away from the street, it is very quiet and renovated with modern features. The sofa bed is extremely comfortable! I felt like a local staying there."
Review 46432 for listing 5396 by Suzanne (46034) on 2010-05-26:"Just a short walk from several Metro stations, Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville, left bank, thus central to any destination in Paris; great bakery, wine, and cheese shops steps away. Lots of foot traffic on the weekends, but the the apartment is quiet and private. Small but well set up. Couldn't ask for better."
Review 53866 for listing 5396 by Charles (69258) on 2010-06-17:"I can not imagine a better location to stay in Paris.  And the value of this apartment is outstanding. Small efficiency apt. but good use of space, tasteful, well stocked (Internet, telephone etc.). Psychologically comfortable, looking out large windows on inner courtyard, which makes the space feel larger. Neighborhood 17th/18th century stone buildings; classy and quiet. Nasrine was helpful and kind."
Review 92977 for listing 5396 by Martin (36827) on 2010-09-08:"I always stay on the Ile Saint Louis when I am in Paris (where I spend 4-6 weeks per year every summer) and so I knew that the location is just perfect for me! Some say the Ile Saint Louis is too touristy in summer, but Borzou's studio is on the quiter, eastern half of the tiny island in the Seine - which is really like a small 17th century village. 

The studio is exactly as advertised:  perfectly located, quiet, 100% updated, small but with all the creature comforts: an A+ ""American"" kitchen w/ a washing machine, flat screen TV w/ cable, wireless Internet connection and a phone w/ free calls from landline to landline. The studio is in the back of a restored building up 2 flights of 17th century wooden stairs.

Within a ONE minute walk is a post office, pharmacy, small supermarket, bakery, butcher - and, of course, loads of restaurants. The Metro (Line 7, the 'pink' line) at Pont-Marie is a FIVE minute walk across the Pont Marie. I am looking forward to my next visit!"
Review 120447 for listing 5396 by Ruta (117667) on 2010-10-17:"Great studio in a perfect location. In the very center of old Paris and all things but very quiet. Very well set-up with wi-fi, washer, and a full kitchen. A Metro station is nearby but we found it was walking distance to everything. The host was warm and welcoming. 

Overall, a wonderful experience.  Highly recommended.

Review 232617 for listing 5396 by Marianne (176451) on 2011-04-20:"Fantastic location, quiet, clean, great place for 2 people.  Host is responsive to questions in a timely manner.  Kitchen has everything you need and things work well."
Review 249396 for listing 5396 by Jeanne (366200) on 2011-05-03:"If you will be out all day sight-seeing in Paris, then this apartment can be a fine rental. It's re-finish is contemporary. The pull-out bed is comfortable. The wi-fi works. It's located on the quiet end of a busy tourist street. There is plenty to do and see within walking distance and 5 minutes from the Metro.

If you think you'll be spending some time hanging out in the apartment, note that there aren't any views out the windows, which look out onto a small courtyard, and, most likely, you'll want to keep the shades drawn for privacy. "
Review 261539 for listing 5396 by Kelly (330028) on 2011-05-13:"My boyfriend and I stayed here last May.  This location is hard to beat.  Perfect location - We only used the metro two or three times during our week stay.  The apartment was cozy and comfortable for two.  Nasrine met us with the keys upon our arrival.  She was very nice and made us feel at home.  Borzou was also very helpful in his communication including restaurant recommendations, sights to see, along with other helpful and practical information for our stay.  Thank you!"
Review 281553 for listing 5396 by Laura (110315) on 2011-05-26:Cozy apartment in a great location!  I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Paris.
Review 336485 for listing 5396 by William (266395) on 2011-06-27:"A wonderful experience! The studio was exactly as the pictures described. we were met on time by gracious Nazerine, and made to feel at home.
A perfect location, yet quiet and relaxing. It was a true home away from home. We can't wait to go back!"
Review 368033 for listing 5396 by Catherine (451974) on 2011-07-12:"As virtually all the reviews note, the apartment is in a great location, clean and quiet.  Highly recommended despite the sofa bed now deeply impregnated with many previous bodies and very old thin pillows. However, perhaps this is part of the value for money equation-- in all other respects the apartment is fantastic. There is also a good range of travel/guide books on Paris in the apartment. "
Review 757080 for listing 5396 by Dana (247117) on 2011-12-01:"Amazing in every way! (Location, amenities, host, etc..)   I loved walking home every day down the narrow streets of the island. Highly recommended - you will love it!"
Review 787726 for listing 5396 by Steve (1221812) on 2011-12-16:I had a great stay in Borzou's apartment; the location was such that I used the Metro much less than on previous visits to Paris.  I will definetly try to arrange another stay here as well as AIRBNB facilities in other locales.
